                <div class="col-md-12"><p>Salve interweb. My name is Silvus Fannia Lacedaemonius and I am taking an EPIC journey in the footsteps of the one, the only, the perpetuator of the Trojan race...AENEAS!!! I’ve read the Aeneid 10 times over, cover to cover and I just can’t enough of Virgil’s EPIC prose. I’ve got my papa’s big, bouncing boat to recreate Aeneas’ journey, travelling through each of the places he went in the first 6 books of the poem.<br><br>So, the plan is to leave Athens (where I am currently) for Troy in a few days. After a few days there I will sail through some of the greek islands including Delos and Crete and finally end up in Sicily. After sicily I’ll head down to Carthage, then make a u-turn and head up to Cumae. Finally, I’ll conclude my journey in Rome, just as Aeneas did.<br><br>Here is my itinerary and cost calculations:</div>
                <div class="col-md-1"></div>
                <div class="col-md-10"><p>Athens → Troy - 165.99, 6 days
<br>Troy - 6 Days
<br>Troy → Delos - 121.02, 4 days
<br>Delos - 5 Days
<br>Delos → Crete (Chersonesos) - 51.37, 2 days
<br>Crete - 4 Days
<br>Crete → Sicily (Panormus) - 302.82, 12 days
<br>Sicily - 3 Days
<br>Sicily → Carthage - 69.54, 3 days
<br>Carthage - 7 Days
<br>Carthage → Cumae - 143.49, 6 days
<br>Cumae - 4 Days
<br>Cumae → Rome - 83.57, 3 days
<br><br>
937.8 denarii, 36 days of travel

So, I am here in Troy and, to be honest, it’s a little underwhelming. We’re on the edge of the empire and there are all these weird easterners around. The city is not in such great shape and doesn’t look much like Virgil described it (no surprise there since it’s been destroyed multiple times over).<br><br>Aeneas mostly described Troy in shambles as the greeks invaded, the homes of his people burning and the palace being crowded with the king Priam, the last Trojan soldiers and surviving commoners alike. I recall one quote from Book II, it stated:
</p></div>
              
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p class="text">et iam Argiua phalanx instructis navibus ibat<br>a Tenedo tacitae per amica silentia lunae<br>litora nota petens, flammas cum regia puppis<br>extulerat, fatisque deum defensus iniquis<br>inclusos utero Danaos et pinea furtim<br>laxat claustra Sinon

              </div>
              
              <div class="col-md-12"><p>So I have since left Troy and sailed to Delos. It’s a very beautiful island with amazing Greek beaches. I’ve been working on that summer bod and am currently strutting my stuff on the same beaches that the handsome Aeneas once landed on. Me and Virgil have a few things in common: one being that we LOVE hot guys. OMG these Delos beach folk are smokin’. <br><br>Anywhoo, when my mind is not consumed with such things, it wanders back to my favorite poem and the purpose of this trip: the Aeneid. It was here that Aeneas and his father misinterpreted the prophecy of Apollo, sending them to Crete to found their people’s city.<br><br>I recall a quote from the Aeneid that sums up my observations here:

</p></div>
              
              <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p class="text">sacra mari colitur medio gratissima tellus<br>Nereidum matri et Neptuno Aegaeo,

<br>immotamque coli dedit et contemnere ventos.

<br>Made immobile and kept storms away.
<br>I was brought here, it accepts the tired ones peacefully

I cannot help but compare myself to this island, once tumultuous and lost, but now finding peace within myself. I’m okay with who I am, DAD! You can’t control me forever! You know what I’m just gonna go on a big trip with YOUR money, how ‘bout that!<br><br>Sorry, about that, I’m just venting a little bit about the...impetus...for this trip.<br><br>BTW check out a sweet pic I took from on top of a hill at Delos!

              <div class="col-md-12"><p>I departed from the beautiful island of Delos and have now come upon the famous island of Crete. The largest island in Greece, this is where Aeneas attempted to found a city until a devastating plague hit, as virgil writes:

                  <p class="text">I was establishing the laws and homes; when suddenly a rotten
<br>Plague came from a corrupted part of the sky
<br>And it infected the trees and crops and a season of death came

</p>
              </div>
              
             <div class="col-md-12"><p>Crete reminds me very much of southern Italy in its climate, but it has only been under Roman control for a couple hundred years and so it maintains a noticeable Greek vibe. Crete has a unique history to it, differing from that of the greek mainland. I hear rumors of some “Mycenaean” empire once ruling these lands. 

<br><br>I found a somewhat ugly statuette of what appears to be a woman carrying a ram. It must be quite old, but seems to be a fusion of Greek and whatever these older Cretian cultures left behind.

            <div class="col-md-12"><p>I’ve been having a great time so far on this trip, following in the steps of Aeneas is super-cool and I haven’t been blowing too much of my daddy’s money, ti-hehe.

<br><br>I have a long voyage ahead of me from Crete to Sicily. I better soak in as much Cretian fun as I can before I leave.

              <div class="col-md-12"><p>Quick update for all my Silvians (love you all btw, big cash giveaway with the extra money when I get back!): we are currently passing through the Straits of Messina, where the boot kicks boats into Sicily. Apparently, there’s this whirlpool and this spider-thingy, but they were too scared to come out and battle your man Silvius. Aeneas was too scared to go through here, but I did it, so maybe I deserve hero-status in my own right!

              <div class="col-md-12"><p>Well, m’ crew made it to Sicily unsathed through the dreaded Straits of Messina, no big deal or anything. Upon landing on shore, I was disappointed a deserted greek didn’t crawl up to me and a scary, shepard, cyclops didn’t walk along the tall hills. I guess they were both scared of my awesome, heroic might as well, HAHAHA. 

<br><br>Ah, I am joking, Silvians, of course I am referencing the time when this happens to Aeneas, and he encounters Polyphemus:

                  <p class="text">He just finished speaking when we saw him on the great hill

<br>And heading towards the known shore: the pastor Polyphemus

             <div class="col-md-12"><p>O, how Virgil encapsulates such a horrifying creature into such lovely poetry! Virgil you’re my HERO! What a lovely place Sicily is nowadays, fully Romanified and an absolute joy. It is amazing that Aeneas, this tired, weary refugee, founded an empire that could spread such power and lovely culture across the Mediterranean and beyond.

             <div class="col-md-12"><p>Carthage played a huge part in the Aeneid, mostly because Dido was the “Dux Femina Facti” there. She falls in love with Aeneas, only to see him leave in search of his destiny, leaving her in a pit of despair and a fire of death. Honestly, I think Dido was being a bit of drama queen with the whole situation, but as the cool Romans say, “these girls be crazy.” 

<br><br>Carthage, after the Punic Wars, has become a Roman hub of commerce and culture, and is an absolutely breathtaking city. It blends so many groups of people: Easterners, Africans, Hispanians, Italians, Greeks.

<br><br>There is some very...Tyrian...stuff left over though. For instance, I came upon a Carthaginian Tophet (pic below, smash that like button), dating all the way back to Dido’s time. Apparently, these Carthaginian creeps would sacrifice children here. Ahhh, that’s totally not okay. Glad we Romans came in and cleaned up the place a little bit to make sure no more children had their throats slit.

I have landed at Cumae, the location of the huge cliffs upon which the temple of Apollo sits and within which lies the Sibyl’s lair. I went through these caves and it was super spooky, I just felt like something was gonna pop out and scare me like those haunted hay rides. Vergil really captured this spookiness in his poetry:

</p></div>

             <div class="col-md-12"><p>On a side note, would you want the powers of the Sibyl to predict the future; comment below! It would be cool for figuring your life out maybe, but isn’t life best when you don’t know what’s ahead?


<br><br>Aeneas came here to be granted access to the underworld and understand his and the Roman people’s destiny. I’ve always wished that my destiny could be intertwined with the Roman people’s in the same way as Aeneas. Maybe I’ll become a senator like my dad. The truth is I really don’t know what’s ahead, and I, like Aeneas, am just trying to figure out what my destiny is. Hopefully it ends with something as great as the Roman empire.

<br><br>PS. - I went to the temple of Apollo while I was here, it was pretty amazing and had some sweet views (check out the pic!)
